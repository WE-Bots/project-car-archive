# Communications
This is code needed by every component - communications code.

## car-wire
ahfergus1's attempt at making a communications library for CAR. Never went anywhere. Left here for reference. Note that this is Arduino/Teensy specific. It won't be great for Teensy though, as it doesn't take advantage of some of its hardawre features.
