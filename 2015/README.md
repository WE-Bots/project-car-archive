#2015 Code

This is the current development code for Project CAR.

##Vision
Code for the vision system.

##Rules
Each team should make a directory, and in each directory there should be a README.md
giving a quick run down of the system. Things to include in this: what is the hardware,
how do we upload, what does the code do... Dates are self evident from the commit dates,
so please don't document dates in code/readme's. All subdirectories of each team should
also have readme's within reason (ie. where explanation to understand basic structure
is needed). DO NOT upload built executables or objects. DO upload test assets.
