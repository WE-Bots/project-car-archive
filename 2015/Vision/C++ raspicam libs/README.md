#C++ RaspiCam Libraries

These are a couple of open source libraries I found on the internet for accessing
and controlling the raspi's camera using OpenCV and whatnot. I'm not sure which
one suits our needs better, so we'll have to try them out.

##A
First C++ library under consideration. Pretty much found at random through Google search.
Might be more flexible.

##B
Second C++ library under consideration. Modified by erget, based on Emil Valkov's work
that was in turn based on Pierre Raufast's work. Basically recommended by Raufast.
Note that this is Emil's repo with erget's changes pulled in. Here's erget's blog post:

##C
Reseach the code from: https://github.com/cedricve/raspicam. This may be the same
as A.

##C
V4L (Video 4 Linux) CSI drivers - this would be excellent, and far more 'official'.
